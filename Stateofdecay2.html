<h1>State of Decay 2</h1>

<h3>State of Decay 2 is an open world zombie survival video game developed by Undead Labs and published by Xbox Game Studios.
    
    It is a sequel to the 2013 video game State of Decay. The game was released on May 22, 2018 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One.
    
    An optimized version was also released for Xbox Series X/S on December 2, 2020.
    
    Like its predecessor, players are required to build a community, manage resources and survive against the horde of zombies.
    
    The game received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its difficulty, musical score and combat, but criticized the technical issues and the lack of depth in the survival and management mechanics.

    A third installment, State of Decay 3 is currently in the works.

<h2>Heartland</h2>

<h3>Heartland features a return to Trumbull Valley in a new story-based adventure. 
    
    Once the iconic site of the original State of Decay game, the towns of Spencer’s Mill and Marshall are now overrun with an advanced form of blood plague: a more aggressive and far deadlier version than exists anywhere else. 
    
    Though it may be familiar territory to those who homesteaded here years ago, Trumbull Valley is packed with new dangers… and unspeakable horrors.

    In Heartland, players choose from two sets of starting characters who have traveled to Trumbull Valley for different reasons. 
    
    Both pairs of survivors are on a mission to find people important to them: characters who appeared in the original State of Decay.

<h2>DayBreak</h2>

<h3>Daybreak is a State of Decay 2 DLC co-op Zombie siege defense mode for up to 4 players online. Where you play as a Random Red Talon (Volunteer) Soldier to Defend a Technician against the zombie horde. Your objective: Keep the Technician Alive & Survive until Daybreak. The siege mode consists of 7 waves that are 5 min. each. Standing between the zombies and the technician there is a wall. The wall consists of several panels that may or may not need to be repaired during the fight or between waves if they become heavily damaged. When you first load in, there will be a heavily damaged wall that will need to be repaired with a repair kit that every player starts with in their inventory. Any player can repair a wall panel so long as they have a repair kit in their inventory. You will also notice 3 boxes at the very back. These boxes start you off with a moderate amount of supplies & equipment to help get you through your first couple of waves. The first 2 waves must be done with what you have on hand and what's in the boxes in the back. After that, CLEO will drop air support containers to aid you in your survival. It is vital to retrieve and loot these resupply containers after every wave. Don't forget to share with your teammates if you have them. You will have approximately 2 mins. between waves to do just that. If the Technician is wounded during the fight you can heal them using a bandage from your inventory if you have one as long as they are not in combat. To do this go to the back of the technician while they are preparing the device and use the button prompt.</h3>
